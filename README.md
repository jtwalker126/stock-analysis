VU Data Analytics Bootcamp Week 2 VBA

# Challenge

The final analysis and challenge file can be found [here.](green_stocks-Challenge.xlsm)

#### Objective
In this file, I have used VBA to rapidly analyze large amounts of financial data in excel. In particular, I searched through stock data to summarize total daily volume of trades and yearly return for several specific stocks. This code is designed for user input to determine which year to search stock data for and then will output the data into a new sheet within the workbook that is formatted for easy readability and interpretation. In the challenge of this assignment, I refactored the code from the assignment to be clearer and more efficient.

#### Analysis
This analysis shows that the stocks that were analyzed performed much better overall in 2017 than 2018. In 2017, all stocks except TERP increased their value with the largest relative rise coming from DQ which had a 199% yearly return. In contrast in 2018, only two stocks had a positive yearly return: RUN and ENPH. 

#### Conclusion
For the data available, ENPH has seen the greatest yearly return and thus may be best stock for Steve's parents to invest in.

#### Limitations
This analysis is entirely based on past data which does not necessarily reflect what will happen with these stocks in the future. To do that, one would need a crystal ball!
